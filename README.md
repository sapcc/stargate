# Stargate

[![Docker Repository](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/sapcc/stargate.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/sapcc/stargate/)

The Stargate opens a gate from [Slack](https://slack.com) to the several systems to enable interaction with these.
The primary gate is opened to the [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager) so one can respond to alerts from Slack.
